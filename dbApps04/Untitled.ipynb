    "    Victor Francis Sunderland was a 20 year old male Farmer from Essex, England. He was travelling to Cleveland, Ohio to visit his uncle J.P. Foley. I chose this type of passenger, because his reasons for embarking would've been the same reason for mine. My criteria for the passenger was to have them be 2nd or 3rd, male, and 16 years old; which the database incorrectly labeled him as 16. He was traveling alone on the Titanic.\n",

    "    Victor Sunderland was on one of the lasts ships to leave the snkig Titanic. He had to hold off people who were trying to get onto the already overcrowded boat. While on the sinking Titanic, he witnessed a first officer of the Titanic shoot someone who refused to give up his spot to a woman. He was smoking on his bunk when the Titanic started sinking, he ran out with his bunkmates. When Sunderland was on his boat he heard the screams and cries of other people in the waters, he heard these for about 20 minutes before they all stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Victor Sunderland got on the Carpthia the next day, he was saved from the boat. He remarked how he was served cold coffee. He later went on to do multiple news interviews and stories about his Titanic recounting. He went on to marry May McNaughton and had a single child, he became a plumber until his retirement in 1939. Victor would live in Toronto and live there the rest of his live after the Titanic with his wife and child. He would in 1977 at the age of 73 in Toronto.\n",
